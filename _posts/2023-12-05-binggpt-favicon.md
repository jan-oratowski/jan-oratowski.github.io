Depending on your preferences go either to OpenAI's DALL-E 2: https://openai.com/dall-e-2, or https://www.bing.com/images/create for Bing GPT (uses DALL-E 3).

From what I understand both websites require registration, but are free to use when creating reasonable amount of images.

To generate my favicon I tried `a favicon for blog about programming and running homelab`, but they looked too high-res, so I tried `a low resolution favicon for blog about programming and running homelab`.

This is how mine looks:

I'm sure I would get better results if I refined this prompt even more, but this was good enough for me.

After you generate something that you are satisfied with, download the image and convert it to PNG. I have used IrfanView for that.

Done, now you have your favicon file you can embed on website.
